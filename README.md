## [Drop Text Tutorial](http://lewislwood.github.io/drop-text-tutorial)

I created this tutorial for blind developers and sighted alike. The goal is to show blind developers especially, how they can develop front end applications as well.  The techniques used to accomplish this wonderful tasks.

Hopefully sighted employers and developers will see how blind people can accomplish this task.  Keep in mind I designed, developed, and typed up this tutorial in 1 week. The grammer took up  3+ of those days. Programming is what I excel at.

This is a tutorial on javascript techniques,VS Code IDE, and how a talking console aids in completion. The Drop Text Panels are a complicated mess of JavaScript, and managing all those conditons must be done in sync. The HTML elements Details & Summary tags do exactly the smae thing with no javascript. It is all done by the browser. Would be a really short tutorial if I did it that way.  Happy coding.

## [VS Code Introduction with Screen Reader](https://lewislwood.github.io/vsCode-Intro-Screen-Reader/)

This GitHub Page implements my [Audio Catalog Generator](http://lewislwood.github.io/ac-gen), which was written in Typescript by me. This VS code Into hosts 15 audio mp3's that can be played. This player mimics the YouTube video controls. Hoveever, this one talks out loud the status of what is playing and position. The 15 mp3's talk about keyboard and utilizing key features that will make developing as a blind developer much easier.

## [JWT Authentification  & Role Authorization](https://github.com/lewislwood/jwt-auth-role-express)

This is a three branch tutorial. I puposely place things in a manner people think and focus. Since at first blind programmers process one line at a time with their senses, vs sighted which see multiple lines and put them together rather quickly. Blind are capable, but when new concepts it may take a few extra moments. S Branch Auth is extremely simple and the controller logic is on the routes. vs seperated out. 2nd branch I implement authorization and introduc guest role as well as owner routes/rights. 3rd move to MVC model, error handling, loggin.
Throughout the 3 branches I have a dedicated testing javascript that I encourage them to run. I will be recording and generating an Audio Catalog GitHub Page for this repository as well.
Other Repositories ---->

## [Really simple Postgresql server](https://github.com/lewislwood/postgresql-persistent-connect)

Start to finish. This is the perfect tool for that and a great learning for those not there yet. Uses Docker & PSQL.
This repository is a twist off another Postgresql containerized SqQL server. Of course you have the standard psql console, connection string ability to include in tyour application. Along with this one I include a small sample backup file. Restore and Backup sql scripts. Some sample  test scripts. An NPM script to run those sample psql scripts I created and any  one you create. This way you can create and test over and over. It is containerized and created in the project folder. Thus easy to integrate with other docker applications using yml files.

## [WordPress in 5 minutes](https://github.com/lewislwood/wordpress-developer-docker)

imagine create a series of scripts to create/upgrade you application database. You will want to do This is a simple Wordpress docker containerized generator. I even created a YouTube video that can be found at [Blind Heroes](http://youtube.com/@blindheroes.org) test it and you can find articles @ my [Blind Heroes Web Site](http://blindheroes.org)  I plan to phase out WordPress and move over to Nextjs

## [Audio Catalog Generator](http://lewislwood.github.io/ac-gen)

 This generator requires no html knowledge. Just drop you mp3 files and a new custom audio catalog is created for you. Simply copy the folders and place as a doc folder in you repository you want an audio catalog or simply place in a folder. The html generated from an express ejs server creates an Audio catalog player.

 This player mimics the YouTube key mappings. This makes learning easier. Also updates the status, time, remaining, and more to the screen reader.

 This Generator screams CLI and that would make it much more simplier and portable. So when I get around I will create another one. So stay tuned.

Stay Tuned I (Lewis L. Wood) will bring you many more ideas in the future. So keep coding.
