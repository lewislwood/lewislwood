## [Drop Text Tutorial](http://lewislwood.github.io/drop-text-tutorial)

I created this tutorial for blind developers and sighted alike. The goal is to show blind developers especially, how they can develop front end applications as well.  The techniques used to accomplish this wonderful tasks. 

Hopefully sighted employers and developers will see how blind people can accomplish this task.  Keep in mind I designed, developed, and typed up this tutorial in 1 week. The grammer took up  3+ of those days. Programming is what I excel at.

## [VS Code Introduction with Screen Reader](https://lewislwood.github.io/vsCode-Intro-Screen-Reader/) 

This GitHub Page implements my [Audio Catalog Generator](http://lewislwood.github.io/ac-gen), which was written in Typescript by me. This VS code Into hosts 15 audio mp3's that can be played. This player mimics the YouTube video controls. Hoveever, this one talks out loud the status of what is playing and position. The 15 mp3's talk about keyboard and utilizing key features that will make developing as a blind developer much easier.

## [JWT Authentification  & Role Authorization](https://github.com/lewislwood/jwt-auth-role-express)

This is a three branch tutorial. I puposely place things in a manner people think and focus. Since at first blind programmers process one line at a time with their senses, vs sighted which see multiple lines and put them together rather quickly. Blind are capable, but when new concepts it may take a few extra moments. S Branch Auth is extremely simple and the controller logic is on the routes. vs seperated out. 2nd branch I implement authorization and introduc guest role as well as owner routes/rights. 3rd move to MVC model, error handling, loggin.
Throughout the 3 branches I have a dedicated testing javascript that I encourage them to run. I will be recording and generating an Audio Catalog GitHub Page for this repository as well.
