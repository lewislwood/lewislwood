## [API Authentification 3 branch Tutorial](https://lewislwood.github.io/jwt-auth-role-express/)

This tutorial is a 3 branch/step tutorial in developing a robust API. A firm understanding of an Express API will be demonstrated and become quite evident in this 3 p part development proccess. How webtokens work and how security is implemented will be understood when you complete this proccess. How to handle authorization/roles for users as part of authentificaton. Error handling how to set a robust and quite customizable error handling to help you find and diagnose the difficulat to locate errors. How to implement a sound logging system, for what ever you want to monitor (requests, types of user request errors, and server errors). Also a robust testing javascript file I developed to hit my server with requests (get & post).

## [VS Code Introduction with Screen Reader](https://lewislwood.github.io/vsCode-Intro-Screen-Reader/)

This GitHub Page implements my [Audio Catalog Generator](http://lewislwood.github.io/ac-gen), which was written in Typescript by me. This VS code Into hosts 15 audio mp3's that can be played. This player mimics the YouTube video controls. Hoveever, this one talks out loud the status of what is playing and position. The 15 mp3's talk about keyboard and utilizing key features that will make developing as a blind developer much easier.

## Web Page Template

This will be a master web page/github page I will use. I will also include a media presentation to explain to blind like me how they too can accomplish some decent output for front end presentation. Getting it in the ballpark.

 Will have a 3 column, 2 comlumn, and 1 column. All will be responsive and have multi them colors and auto dark and light them selectors.

## [Drop Text Tutorial](http://lewislwood.github.io/drop-text-tutorial)

I created this tutorial for blind developers and sighted alike. The goal is to show blind developers especially, how they can develop front end applications as well.  The techniques used to accomplish this wonderful tasks.

Hopefully sighted employers and developers will see how blind people can accomplish this task.  Keep in mind I designed, developed, and typed up this tutorial in 1 week. The grammer took up  3+ of those days. Programming is what I excel at.

This is a tutorial on javascript techniques,VS Code IDE, and how a talking console aids in completion. The Drop Text Panels are a complicated mess of JavaScript, and managing all those conditons must be done in sync. The HTML elements Details & Summary tags do exactly the smae thing with no javascript. It is all done by the browser. Would be a really short tutorial if I did it that way.  Happy coding.

## [Really simple Postgresql server](https://github.com/lewislwood/postgresql-persistent-connect)

Start to finish. This is the perfect tool for that and a great learning for those not there yet. Uses Docker & PSQL.
This repository is a twist off another Postgresql containerized SqQL server. Of course you have the standard psql console, connection string ability to include in tyour application. Along with this one I include a small sample backup file. Restore and Backup sql scripts. Some sample  test scripts. An NPM script to run those sample psql scripts I created and any  one you create. This way you can create and test over and over. It is containerized and created in the project folder. Thus easy to integrate with other docker applications using yml files.

## [WordPress in 5 minutes](https://github.com/lewislwood/wordpress-developer-docker)

imagine create a series of scripts to create/upgrade you application database. You will want to do This is a simple Wordpress docker containerized generator. I even created a YouTube video that can be found at [Blind Heroes](http://youtube.com/@blindheroes.org) test it and you can find articles @ my [Blind Heroes Web Site](http://blindheroes.org)  I plan to phase out WordPress and move over to Nextjs

## [Audio Catalog Generator](http://lewislwood.github.io/ac-gen)

 This generator requires no html knowledge. Just drop you mp3 files and a new custom audio catalog is created for you. Simply copy the folders and place as a doc folder in you repository you want an audio catalog or simply place in a folder. The html generated from an express ejs server creates an Audio catalog player.

 This player mimics the YouTube key mappings. This makes learning easier. Also updates the status, time, remaining, and more to the screen reader.

 This Generator screams CLI and that would make it much more simplier and portable. So when I get around I will create another one. So stay tuned.

Stay Tuned I (Lewis L. Wood) will bring you many more ideas in the future. So keep coding.
